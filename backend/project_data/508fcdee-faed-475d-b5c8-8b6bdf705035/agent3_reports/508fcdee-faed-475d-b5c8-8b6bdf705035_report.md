**Phosphate Adsorption in Wastewater Treatment Using Calcium-Enriched Biochar from Sheep Manure and Oyster Shells**  

---

## Abstract  
This project evaluates the efficacy of calcium-enriched biochar derived from sheep manure and oyster shells for phosphate adsorption in wastewater treatment. Key findings include a maximum Langmuir adsorption capacity of **146.28 mg P/g** and **94% efficiency** at 50 mg P/L. Challenges such as interference from nitrate and sulfate ions and pH-dependent performance (optimal at pH >7) were identified. Future research directions include material regeneration, scalability, and real-world wastewater testing.

## Performance Analysis and Characterization  
### Adsorption Capacity and Efficiency  
| **Metric**                | **Value**               |  
|----------------------------|--------------------------|  
| Langmuir maximum capacity | 146.28 mg P/g           |  
| Sips model capacity       | 121.29 mg P/g           |  
| Pseudo-second-order capacity | 102.84 mg P/g |  
| Efficiency at 50 mg P/L   | 94%                     |  

### Characterization Techniques  
- **BET analysis**: Used to assess surface area and porosity, critical for understanding adsorption mechanisms[2][4].

## Discussion (Commonalities, Divergences, Limitations)  
### Key Observations  
1. **Model Comparisons**:  
   - **Langmuir vs. Sips**: Higher Langmuir capacity (146.28 mg P/g) suggests monolayer adsorption dominance, while Sips accounts for heterogeneous binding sites.  
   - **Kinetic vs. Equilibrium**: Pseudo-second-order equilibrium capacity (102.84 mg P/g) aligns with Langmuir’s monolayer assumption.  

2. **Efficiency and Limitations**:  
   - **High efficiency (94%)** at 50 mg P/L demonstrates practical applicability.  
   - **Interference from NO₃⁻/SO₄²⁻**: Competing anions reduce adsorption efficiency, a challenge noted in prior studies[1].  
   - **pH dependency**: Optimal performance under alkaline conditions (pH >7) suggests precipitation or ligand-exchange mechanisms[1].
