      "abstract_snippet": "Metal oxide-loaded biochars are a promising material to remove phosphate from polluted water to ultra-low concentrations. The study compares adsorption capacities of biochars modified with different metal oxides (Al, Ca, Fe, La, Mg) and identifies metal oxide content as the primary factor determining adsorption capacity.",
