# Advancements in Quantum Dot Light-Emitting Diodes: Synthesis and Performance Analysis  

## Abstract  
This report synthesizes findings from two recent studies on quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs), focusing on synthesis innovations and performance benchmarks. Key achievements include record luminance (1.6 million cd/m²), high photoluminescence quantum yield (91%), and extended operational lifetimes (t₉₅ = 15,600 hours). Challenges persist in bridging performance gaps with cadmium-based QLEDs and mitigating surface defects in core-shell structures. Future research directions emphasize full-color display commercialization, blue-emitting architectures, and light-extraction enhancements.
