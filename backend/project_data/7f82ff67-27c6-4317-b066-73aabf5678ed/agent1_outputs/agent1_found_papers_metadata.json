      "abstract_snippet": "This review traces nanocrystal quantum dot (QD) research from the early discoveries to the present day and into the future. We describe the extensive body of theoretical and experimental knowledge that comprises the modern science of QDs. Indeed, the spatial confinement of electrons, holes, and excitons in nanocrystals, coupled with the ability of modern chemical synthesis to make complex designed structures, is today enabling multiple applications of QD size-tunable electronic and optical properties.",
