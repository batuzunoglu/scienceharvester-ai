# Sustainable Biochar for Phosphate Removal and Advanced Patterning Techniques for High-Efficiency QLEDs  

## Abstract  
This report synthesizes findings from two studies: one on sustainable phosphate removal using biochar and another on quantum dot light-emitting diode (QLED) patterning. Key materials include calcium-enriched biochar derived from sheep manure/oyster shells and quantum dots (QDs) with 97% photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) retention after UV exposure. The biochar achieved a maximum phosphate adsorption capacity of 146.28 mg P/g, while red QLEDs demonstrated a 19.1% external quantum efficiency (EQE). Common limitations include scalability challenges and moderate blue QD stability. These findings highlight progress in environmental
