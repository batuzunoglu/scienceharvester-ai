# Project Specific Data / Logs (YOU SHOULD CUSTOMIZE THIS SECTION)
# These are directories and files specific to YOUR application's runtime data or local state.

# Backend data (that shouldn't be versioned)
project_data/           # Contains all project-specific agent outputs
projects_db.json        # Your local projects database
local_agent1_test_outputs/ # Output from Agent 1 local testing script
agent2_temp_input_pdfs/ # Temporary PDFs for Agent 2
# If you had old global output directories before project-specific paths, add them:
# agent1_outputs/
# agent2_paper_extractions/
# agent3_reports/
# agent2_input_pdfs/ # If this was your old global temp dir for agent2
